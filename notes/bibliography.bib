    abstract = "{JPred4 (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred4) is the latest version of the popular JPred protein secondary structure prediction server which provides predictions by the JNet algorithm, one of the most accurate methods for secondary structure prediction. In addition to protein secondary structure, JPred also makes predictions of solvent accessibility and coiled-coil regions. The JPred service runs up to 94 000 jobs per month and has carried out over 1.5 million predictions in total for users in 179 countries. The JPred4 web server has been re-implemented in the Bootstrap framework and JavaScript to improve its design, usability and accessibility from mobile devices. JPred4 features higher accuracy, with a blind three-state (α-helix, β-strand and coil) secondary structure prediction accuracy of 82.0\\% while solvent accessibility prediction accuracy has been raised to 90\\% for residues \\&lt;5\\% accessible. Reporting of results is enhanced both on the website and through the optional email summaries and batch submission results. Predictions are now presented in SVG format with options to view full multiple sequence alignments with and without gaps and insertions. Finally, the help-pages have been updated and tool-tips added as well as step-by-step tutorials.}",

SCOPe also incorporates and updates the ASTRAL compendium, which provides multiple databases and tools to aid in the analysis of the sequences and structures of proteins classified in SCOPe. Protein structures are classified using a combination of manual curation and highly precise automated methods. In the current release of SCOPe, 2.07, we have focused our manual curation efforts on larger protein structures, including the spliceosome, proteasome and RNA polymerase I, as well as many other Pfam families that had not previously been classified. Domains from these large protein complexes are distinctive in several ways: novel non-globular folds are more common, and domains from previously observed protein families often have N- or C-terminal extensions that were disordered or not present in previous structures. The current monthly release update, SCOPe 2.07–2018-10–18, classifies 90 992 PDB entries (about two thirds of PDB entries).}",
